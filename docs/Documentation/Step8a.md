The eighth step in PNET is to collect all extracted field reaches and merge them into one shapefile containing all data for that entire watershed. The inputs for this tool are:



- Project Folder

  - This is the folder that contains all data for the project. Folders with the prefix "00_" will be ignored.

    

  This tool is simple. For every watershed, field reaches with extracted data are merged together into one watershed-wide collection of field reaches. Each field reach will now contain all data from every data network.
