The sixth step in PNET is to prepare every data network to have its data extracted. The inputs for this tool are:

- Project Folder
  - This is the folder that contains all data for the project. Folders with the prefix "00_" will be ignored.
- All Data Networks
  - These data networks should contain all of the data that you will want to compare later. 
  - Each data network must be based on the same stream network that was input for step 1. 

The only item in this step is that the data networks are clipped by each watershedâ€™s stream network and saved into the appropriate folder. These data networks will be extracted in the next step. It is crucial that these data networks are based on the same stream network you ran the tool with initially. The data network needs to overlap every field reach.
