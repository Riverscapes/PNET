The sixth step in PNET is to prepare every data network to have its data extracted. The inputs for this tool are:

- Root Folder
- A list of data networks. These shapefiles should be a single project-wide data network.
- A list of network names. This will be used to save the data networks into each watershed’s folder.

  The only item in this step is that the data networks are clipped by each watershed’s stream network and saved into the appropriate folder. These data networks will be extracted in the next step. It is crucial that these data networks are based on the same stream network you ran the tool with initially. The data network needs to overlap every field reach.
