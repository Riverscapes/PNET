## About

Welcome to the PNET website. The **Point and Network Extration Tool** (PNET) is tool with many different applications, the primary one being the comparison of data collected in the field and data generated from network scale models. This guide serves as a walkthrough through the different steps in PNET, with descriptions of the inputs and outputs of each step. 

PNET was developed in collaboration with PIBO, and as such, much of PNET's function is related to the way PIBO handles their data. The purpose of this tool is to produce easily readable graphs to display the correlation between reach scale data collected in the field, and network scale data generated by models.
