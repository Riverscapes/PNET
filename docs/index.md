## About

Welcome to the PNET website. The **Point and Network Extration Tool** (PNET) is tool with many different applications, the primary one being the comparison of data collected in the field and data generated from network scale models. This guide serves as a walkthrough through the different steps in PNET, with descriptions of the inputs and outputs of each step. 

First, Top of Reach and Bottom of reach points collected in the field are snapped to a given stream network. Then, a reach is created between those two points, using the stream network. That reach is assumed to be representative of how the reach was in the field. Next, data from any network scale models can be extracted onto those reaches and points. Finally, a table is generated with fields from the field reaches and from data networks. Statistical comparisons can now be made.
